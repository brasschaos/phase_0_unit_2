# U2.W4: Add it up!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input? The input is an array of numbers
# What is the output? The output is the sum of the numbers in the array
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem? I will iterate over the array, adding the next number to a total within a variable
# that it returns after the loop is complete


# 2. Initial Solution
def total(array) {
	array.each do |i|
		toats = toats + i
}
return toats



# 3. Refactored Solution



# 4. Reflection
